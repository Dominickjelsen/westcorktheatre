    <u>Broadway Review: ‘Hadestown’</u>
</h3>
<body>
<p>
    “Hadestown” triggered a lot of buzz when this wholly American show (which
    came to the stage by way of a concept album) premiered at Off Broadway’s
    New York Theatre Workshop in 2016. Arriving on Broadway with its earthly
    delights more or less intact, this perfectly heavenly musical — with book,
    music and lyrics by Anaïs Mitchell — should stick around for a while.
</p>
<p>
    Although the production has lost some of the electricity that goes with
    playing in the round, director Rachel Chavkin (“Natasha, Pierre, and the
    Great Comet of 1812”), who also helped with the show’s development, has
    done a super job of adapting this pretty thing for a proscenium stage. What
    it loses scenically — namely, a visual sense of the arduous nature of the
    hero’s journeys to and from the underworld — it makes up for in other ways.
</p>
<p>
    A helpful program note offers a bit of classical background for anyone who
    doesn’t recall that Orpheus (Reeve Carney) and Eurydice (Eva Noblezada)
    were more-than-mortal lovers torn apart when Eurydice died and went to
    Hades. Or that the poet Orpheus took his enchanted lyre and descended into
    those Stygian depths to bring her back. The storytelling is spare, but the
    visuals say it all, helped along by the melodious voice and slip-sliding
    dance moves of the indomitable André De Shields as the swift-footed god
    Hermes, as well as by the three gorgeous, golden-throated Fates played by
    Jewelle Blackman, Yvette Gonzalez-Nacer and Kay Trinidad.
</p>
<p>
    The world on top looks (and sounds) a bit like New Orleans (“Livin’ It Up
    on Top”), especially in the hands of a terrific seven-piece onstage
    orchestra whose trombonist was born to wail. But the real action happens in
    hell, depicted here by the entire company in a rousing number, “Way Down
    Hadestown,” that could make the dead dance. Here, Hades (Patrick Page, in
    imposing form and thunderous voice), the fearsome King of the Underworld,
    torments the souls of the damned by chaining them to an infernal machine
    that goes nowhere but must be kept in perpetual motion — one memorable
    vision in a production full of striking images.
</p>
<p>
    In the seductive “Hey, Little Songbird,” Hades spies the newly dead
    Eurydice and makes a move to claim her. Lucky for her, the seasons have
    turned and winter has come, bringing the goddess Persephone (played by the
    goddess Amber Gray), patron of spring and fertility, to rule for six months
    as Queen of the Underworld. With this goddess in residence, the King will
    get no action tonight — or for the next six months. Dazzling in a gown of
    spring-bud green and full of life even among the dead, Gray tosses her
    curls and Persephone claims her throne in Hadestown (“Our Lady of the
    Underground”), keeping this rowdy party, choreographed by David Neumann,
    going through the dead of winter.
</p>
<p>
    Despite the lusty partying that goes on, Hadestown is still a place of
    frightening darkness (and fiery, fearsome redness, in Bradley King’s
    lighting design). And while neither Mitchell nor her director makes an
    overt attempt to put a contemporary spin on the material, there is one
    number, “Why We Build the Wall,” that clearly resonates.
