        The new Broadway musical Hadestown has all the makings of a huge cult
        hit.

<body>
<p>
    Hadestown, the new musical that opened on Broadway April 17, has had one of
    the most public evolutions of any musical I know of. It started as a song
    cycle touring around Vermont in 2006, and from there became a star-studded
    concept album with a cult following. Then it was an off-Broadway show. Then
    it hit Canada. Then London. Every step of the way, it’s been under public
    scrutiny.
</p>
<p>
    But what’s most amazing about it is that every time it’s evolved, Hadestown
    has only gotten better.
</p>
<p>
    When I first fell in love with the show as a concept album in 2010, I knew
    Anaïs Mitchell’s folk-inflected score was beautiful, and the premise — the
    myth of Orpheus and Eurydice reimagined as an anti-capitalist parable — was
    compelling.
</p>
<p>
    But I wasn’t sure it would work as a theatrical show. The central metaphor
    of capitalism as death was so abstract, and the mythic characters so much
    better as archetypes than as psychologically distinct human beings, that I
    worried literalizing the whole thing by putting it onstage would break
    everything to pieces.
</p>
<p>
    In the Broadway production of Hadestown, sumptuously directed by Rachel
    Chavkin of Natasha, Pierre, &amp; the Great Comet of 1812 fame, the
    metaphor is a little bit incoherent. The narrative is a little bit shaggy,
    and some of the characters are a little bit flat. But Hadestown in its
    final form, revised and workshopped and thoroughly thought through, rises
    above the sum of its parts.
</p>
<p>
    It creeps under your skin and stays there so ably that in the theater, you
    can actually see the cult following develop in real time. When the house
    lights came up for intermission at the performance I saw, three unconnected
    people who were not sitting together said “holy crap” in unison. The man in
    front of me told me that he had seen the show five times already; counting
    previews, Hadestown had been on Broadway for about three weeks and
    officially open for just five days. Then the lights came back down, and the
    audience all turned back to the stage, waiting for the climax where we
    would all gasp as one at the same moment — because this show is, in the
    most literal sense of the word, breathtaking.
</p>
<p>
    Hadestown handles mythic cycles of death and rebirth with as much aplomb as
    it does contemporary questions about making art in a capitalist world
</p>
<p>
    In classical mythology, Orpheus is the greatest bard in the world and
    Eurydice his beloved bride. When Eurydice is killed by a snake bite, the
    mourning Orpheus travels to the underworld to beg Hades, god of the dead,
    to return his wife to life. To make his case, Orpheus sings a song so
    beautiful that Hades’s wife Persephone, the personification of spring, begs
    her husband to let Eurydice go.
</p>
<p>
    In Mitchell’s Hadestown, the outlines of the myth are the same — but here,
    Hadestown isn’t just the underworld. It’s also a factory town, and Hades is
    both the grim god of death and a malevolent overseer, forcing his tenants
    to labor unceasingly at building an endless wall around his city. (Lest you
    think that part is too on the nose for 2019, Hades’s call and response song
    “Why We Build the Wall” has been part of the show for more than 10 years.
    Mitchell says any resemblance to Trumpian rhetoric is “purely archetypal.”)
</p>
<p>
    And here, Eurydice isn’t bitten by a snake. Instead, she’s lured into
    Hadestown by the promise of work and food, after the impractical artist
    Orpheus spends the winter crafting a song and not bringing any money home.
    “It’s my gut I can’t ignore,” Eurydice sings plaintively. “Orpheus, I’m
    hungry.”
</p>
<p>
    This balancing act is the trickiest part of bringing Hadestown to the
    stage. On an album, Eurydice can simultaneously die and get a factory job,
    and the listening audience doesn’t have to choose between one side of the
    metaphor or the other, because we don’t have to watch her do it. We just
    understand that she’s doing both and let the story keep going. Onstage,
    though, everything by necessity has to get just a little bit more literal.
</p>
<p>
    That’s where Rachel Chavkin’s direction comes in. Chavkin has created a
    theatrical world in which both levels of Mitchell’s metaphor can breathe at
    once. When Eurydice holds up over her eyes the two silver coins that are
    her ticket to the underworld, she is recognizably dying. But she’s also
    getting on the train to a factory town, and she’s doing each at once, right
    in front of our eyes.
</p>
<p>
    In that endeavor, Chavkin is helped enormously by her able crew. Rachel
    Hauck’s scenic design loosely suggests a New Orleans bar for the part of
    the show that takes place above ground, but her whirling pendulum-swinging
    lamps and spinning turntables can just as easily create a sense of
    overwhelming oppression and claustrophobia, like being stuck in a factory
    or a mine — or in hell. And Michael Krass’s costumes are dancing right on
    the edge you didn’t know existed between New Orleans jazz chic and the
    latest in Hellenistic trends. Take a look at the smoke-gray dresses on the
    three Fates: depending on how you squint, they’re either church lady
    outfits or they’re gowns that wouldn’t look out of place on a Greek vase.
</p>
<p>
    It helps, too, that Mitchell has revised her material heavily as she took
    it from studio to stage. Over the past nine years, her lyrics have gotten
    less hazily lyrical and pretty, and more character-driven and concrete.
    While there’s a bit of a tradeoff being made there (I’ll admit to sighing
    over the loss of this lovely image from Hades and Persephone’s first
    meeting: “The smell of the flowers she held in her hand, / The pollen that
    fell from her fingertips, / And suddenly Hades was only a man, / With the
    taste of nectar on his lips”), that revision means that the story now feels
    more organic to the characters. These people aren’t making their choices
    just because they’re archetypal figures in ancient myths and this is what
    they’ve always done, but because those choices make sense. Suddenly they
    feel fresh and urgent.
</p>
<p>
    Mitchell has also given substantially more emphasis in this version of the
    show to the B-plot of Hades and Persephone and their tortured marriage, and
    in this choice, she is most likely driven by the fact that Patrick Page and
    Amber Gray — who have been part of the show since its 2016 production at
    the New York Theatre Workshop — are easily the standouts of the cast. As
    Hades, Page stalks across the stage like a tiger, pitching his velvety bass
    so low that his voice seems to rumble up from the center of the Earth. And
    as the smoky-voiced Persephone, hiding deep wells of melancholy under a
    desperate and drunken smile, Gray doesn’t so much run away with the show as
    dances off with it, with her torso at a 90-degree angle to her legs.
</p>
<p>
    Page and Gray are ably backed up by the legendary André De Shields, who
    plays Hermes, the messenger god and the show’s narrator, with ice-cold
    swagger. As our central lovers, Eva Noblezada (Eurydice) and Reeve Carney
    (Orpheus) have a tougher row to hoe: Orpheus and Eurydice carry the weight
    of the metaphor, and as such, they continue to feel a little bit more like
    flattened-out archetypes than fully fledged characters. Still, Noblezada
    gives Eurydice a winsome survivor’s pluck, and Carney manages to find a
    sweet awkwardness in Orpheus that makes that character feel more likable
    and compelling than he has been in previous versions of this show.
</p>
<p>
    And when all of them come together in the climax of the show, the moment
    that made everyone gasp in unison wasn’t because of some brand new plot
    twist, an innovation to the myth. It was because of the moment that is at
    the center of the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice, the moment on their walkout
    of the underworld that you always knew was coming — somehow now made both
    inevitable and shocking.
</p>
<p>
    “It’s an old song,” Hermes tells us as the show opens. “It’s a sad song.
    But we sing it anyway.”
</p>
<p>
    Hadestown has now been sung over and over again since 2006. It’s been sung
    in concert halls across Vermont. It’s been sung in studio for the concept
    album. It’s been sung off-Broadway, in Canada, and in London. But Mitchell
    and Chavkin keep singing it anyway.
</p>
<p>
    And every time they do, it keeps getting better.
