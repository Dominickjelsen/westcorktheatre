    <u>BWW Review: Stratford's OEDIPUS REX is Phenomenal</u>
</h3>
<body>
<p>This season, audiences are being thrilled by a phenomenal production of OEDIPUS REX at the Stratford Festival's Tom Patterson Theatre to thunderous applause. Superb performances by all bolstered this production of the famous play by Sophocles to the top of my 'Must See' list for this season.
<p>
Director, Daniel Brooks makes his Stratford debut with this production about the infamous King who is desperately seeking the truth only to find all of his worst nightmares realized. He has left quite an impression. Although OEDIPUS is a play that has been around for centuries, this timeless production feels fresh and new. This is largely in part to Mr. Brooks' direction, and the sleek, simple, and quite frankly, brilliant set design by Camellia Koo, combined with inspired lighting design by Michael Walton.
<p>
The set for this production is a sterile, sparse environment-appropriate for a kingdom dealing with a plague. A long metallic table sits at the end of the stage, and floodlights shine down on it, causing several scenes to feel almost like a police interrogation. At any mention of the plague that was cursing Oedipus' kingdom, the lights would flicker forebodingly, adding to the thick foreshadowing that already exists in the dialogue.
<p>
The cast in this production is sensational. Gord Rand is captivating as King Oedipus. His relentless search for the ultimate truth is gut wrenching to watch as an audience member who knows much more about him than he knows about himself. His pain and devastation is palpable as he realizes that the fate he has sacrificed so much to avoid has happened anyways. Equally fantastic is Yanna McIntosh as Jocasta. It is heartbreaking to see her slowly realize a devastating truth, and then desperately try to shield Oedipus from pain that truth would cause him.
<p>
Nigel Bennett is superb as Teiresias, the blind prophet who warns Oedipus that not is all as it seems. In Greek mythology, Teiresias was turned into a woman for 7 years, and, perhaps as an homage to that, the character in this play wears jewelry and high heels. Kudos to Mr. Bennett for portraying a character who cannot see, (and therefore cannot be looking around) whilst also strutting around the stage in heels.
<p>
The chorus is a key element in making this production a success. Their movement and speech is very powerful throughout, as they take turns approaching a microphone, taking the time to adjusting it to their height, and then leading the rest of the chorus in a chant. Everyone in the chorus is dressed similarly, in almost futuristic-type costumes, and at one point, even in ritualistic make-up. When the chorus speaks, it almost feels like a call and response church sermon, led by different chorus members throughout the play.
<p>
There is not a weak link to this entire production. It is certainly a must see at the Festival this year.
