    <u>Review: The Metamorphosis of ‘Hadestown,’ From Cool to Gorgeous</u>
</h3>
<body>
<p>
    All your favorite Greeks are heading somewhere in “Hadestown,” the
    sumptuous, hypnotic and somewhat hyperactive musical that opened on
    Wednesday night after its own twisty 13-year road to Broadway.
</p>
<p>
    Eurydice descends to the underworld; Orpheus follows to retrieve her.
    Persephone spends six months aboveground living the good life of summer and
    song before returning for six months below with Hades. (He’s her husband.)
    Hermes, of course, has wings on his feet. And the Fates (at least in this
    version) are always darting about, minding everyone’s business.
</p>
<p>
    But watching “Hadestown” unfold so gorgeously at the Walter Kerr Theater, I
    found myself thinking of other Greek characters: those lucky few saved from
    heartbreak by radical metamorphoses.
</p>
<p>
    That’s because “Hadestown” — written by Anaïs Mitchell, developed and
    directed by Rachel Chavkin — has itself been radically transformed. What’s
    onstage at the Kerr is almost unrecognizably different from the version I
    saw at New York Theater Workshop in 2016. There, it was garbled and
    precious, too cool for its own good, let alone Broadway.
</p>
<p>
    The gods, or more likely Ms. Chavkin and her creative team, have saved
    “Hadestown” on its way uptown — via Edmonton and London — by turning it
    into something very much warmer, if not yet ideally warm. The story is
    clearer, the songs express that story more directly and the larger themes
    arise from it naturally rather than demanding immediate attention like
    overeager undergraduates.
</p>
<p>
    All this has been done with hardly a change to the plot, which cleverly
    grafts its two myths into one. In Ms. Mitchell’s telling, Eurydice (Eva
    Noblezada) winds up in hell because of the frost and famine that follow
    when Persephone (Amber Gray) pays Hades her annual conjugal visit.
    (Classically, Eurydice just dies of a snakebite.) And because Hades
    (Patrick Page) now has a thing for Eurydice, it’s the jealous Persephone
    who convinces him to let Orpheus (Reeve Carney) take her back.
</p>
<p>
    Even Hermes, who doesn’t really belong in either story, has been recruited
    to narrate, contextualize and kibitz. And why not, if it gives the great
    André De Shields a chance to slide around in silver sharkskin? It’s he who
    tells us — in what is now, correctly, the opening number — that what we’re
    about to hear is “a sad song” no matter how jaunty it sounds. Also that
    he’s “gonna sing it anyway.”
</p>
<p>
    That’s a pretty good précis of the original myths, but Ms. Mitchell,
    fascinated by them since childhood, has taken them further as she expanded
    the material from song cycle to concept album to show. In the story of
    Orpheus and Eurydice she tugs on the tension between art and domesticity:
    What good is beauty if you’re hungry? And the struggle between Hades and
    Persephone naturally becomes a parable of climate change, in which the
    despoiling of the earth is akin to infidelity.
</p>
<p>
    To make these points, “Hadestown” moves the tale to an earth that resembles
    sassy New Orleans, with hell a demonic foundry. As such, Ms. Mitchell’s
    score combines folk, pop and Dixieland with rhythmic work shanties and, for
    the lovers, ethereal arias. All of it sounds great in swinging arrangements
    for a terrific seven-piece onstage band.
</p>
<p>
    Other than some reordering, that’s mostly just as it was three years ago —
    at least on the surface. But if there’s one thing this “Hadestown” is
    pushing, it’s the idea that what really matters is happening where you
    can’t see it.
</p>
<p>
    Underneath the hood, a million small adjustments have been made, especially
    to the lyrics, which have shed some of their pop haze in favor of
    specificity. The Fates, a girl-group trio, now feel more integral to the
    action, not just witty commenters on it. And a new chorus of five hunky
    workers expands not only the sound but also the theme of security attained
    at the expense of freedom.
</p>
<p>
    Yet the most obvious transformation is visual: “Hadestown” is now performed
    on a proscenium stage instead of in a miniature Greek amphitheater. Though
    still high-concept, Rachel Hauck’s single set depicts a recognizable idea
    of place: a basement jazz joint that miraculously turns into the furnace
    room of Hades’ factory. This is emblematic of the production’s choice to
    deliver the story to the audience in as close to the Broadway manner as the
    material can accommodate.
</p>
<p>
    In truth, it can only accommodate so much. “Hadestown,” even with the heat
    turned up, is still a somewhat abstract experience, mediated by several
    layers of narration from Hermes, the Fates and many of the songs. A feeling
    is as likely to be described as enacted, and Ms. Mitchell develops her
    larger themes mostly through metaphor. This can get tiring; even though so
    much of what happens happens beautifully, I began to feel it would be
    better shorter.
</p>
<p>
    The main story suffers most from this problem: Outside of their arias,
    Orpheus and Eurydice are blandly written and thus performed. What starts
    off as a smart riff on “Rent” — poor bohemian girl falls for musician who
    can’t finish his song — soon becomes vague and merely pretty. Attempts to
    complicate the characters’ psychology backfire, and their climactic ascent
    from the underworld, the one thing that worked perfectly downtown, now
    doesn’t. They merely walk in circles.
</p>
<p>
    Luckily, the second story is direct and vivid throughout. Mr. Page, rocking
    a Leon Redbone look and rumble, makes an electrifyingly maleficent Hades,
    even without playing up the Trumpian parallels that have overtaken the
    material. (One of his songs, written more than a decade ago, is called “Why
    We Build the Wall.”)
</p>
<p>
    And Ms. Gray, never better, makes something quite brilliant out of
    Persephone: a free spirit, a loose cannon, a first lady co-opted by wealth
    yet emotionally subversive. When, as part of the curtain call, she sings
    the score’s loveliest number — “I Raise My Cup” — you at last wish the show
    would slow down so you could live in the glowy moment forever.
</p>
<p>
    Along the way there, Ms. Chavkin has probably come as close as anyone could
    to selling a cerebral downtown story as state-of-the-art Broadway
    entertainment. Like the sets and musical arrangements, the costumes (by
    Michael Krass), the lighting (by Bradley King) and the sound design (by
    Nevin Steinberg and Jessica Paz) are as good as it gets.
</p>
<p>
    The result is just as busily beautiful as Ms. Chavkin’s production of
    “Natasha, Pierre &amp; the Great Comet of 1812” — and more coherent. Which
    almost gets you over the hiccup that a show so fundamentally despairing
    (“It’s a sad song”) is now so aggressively welcoming.
</p>
<p>
    Don’t let that distract you, though, from its quiet point, buried in a
    lyric near the end: that we sing the sad song again and again the way we
    play solitaire: “as if it might turn out this time.”
</p>
<p>
    For “Hadestown” — if not yet for us — it has.
